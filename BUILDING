Building rmapper is easy - it requires a C compiler (gcc and icc have been
used during development) and gmake. Intel's C Compiler (icc) is _highly_
recommended as it is often at least 10-20% faster than gcc. All official
SHRiMP binary releases are compiled using icc.

Please note that rmapper is x86-only. Pentium 4 architectures seem to benefit
considerably from 64-bit compiled code, whereas Core 2 architectures don't
seem to care much.

When building with icc, execute the following:
    gmake CC="icc" CFLAGS="-Kc++ -wd383,981,1572 -axP -O3 -ipo"

When building with gcc, execute the following:
    gmake CC="g++" CFLAGS="-O3 -mmmx -msse -msse2"
GCC 4 users should also supply appropriate -ftree-vectorize and -march flags.

Debugging and assertion features may be turned off by adding "-NDEBUG" to the
CFLAGS argument. However, at present assertions don't appear to cost much and
any improvement in performance will be very small.

You may want to adjust your flags depending on your hardware and compiler
versions. The above icc CFLAGS seemed optimal for both Pentium 4 and Core 2
architectures.
