Usage
-----

The distribution makes use of several programs. The first and most important
is 'rmapper'. 'rmapper' performs Smith-Waterman alignments of multiple reads
within one fasta file against a single reftig in another fasta file. Since
many reads are mapped against only one reftig per invocation, rmapper must
be run multiple times against each reftig (and reverse complement) of the
entire genome. The utility 'tools/splittigs' can be used to split a genome
file containing multiple reftigs into individual parts.

Once rmapper has been run, the standard output format of all alignments
should be parsed via the 'tools/finalpass' program. This code analyses all
alignment output, saving the top 'n' matches per read, and calculates the
probability of the match being bad. A threshold removes all outputs with a
sufficiently high p-value.

The output produced by the 'finalpass' utility is essentially a subset of
the input, but with an added p-value field. These matches may then have
their full alignments printed using the 'finalprint' utility.

Biology lab in collaboration with the Stanford University Sidow Lab.

The development of this distribution was made possible in part by a
National Engineering and Research Council of Canada Undergraduate Student
Research Award (NSERC USRA).
