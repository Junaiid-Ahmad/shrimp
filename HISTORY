1.0.5: March 25, 2008
	- Increased spaced seed weight by 2 for letter space, as 454 and
	  Illumina/Solexa reads are generally longer than AB.
	- Changed default gap open penalty from -300 to -400.
	- Changed default crossover penalty from -120 to -140 (for ABI SOLiD).
	- Disabled kmer pruning by default. This feature sometimes prunes too
	  many kmers and confuses users. It still offers an important speed-up,
	  but the user should be aware of (and responsible for) its use.
	- Fixed handling of wobble codes on the negative strand.
	- Handle `.' ambiguous bases as `N'.
	- Fixed whitespace and MS-DOS newline fasta parsing problems affecting
	  Illumina/Solexa and 454 users.
	- Fixed wobble code handling for negative strands.
	- Added read length relative parameters to rmapper. Now -h, -v, and -w
	  can take either absolute or percentage arguments (differentiated by
	  a '.' or '%' in the string). This allows more flexible score
	  thresholding and windowing for input with differing read lengths
	  (454, especially).
	- Fixed a few GCC 4 compiler warnings.

1.0.4: January 24, 2008
	- Changed rmapper default parameters to be more appropriate for the
	  human genome.
	- Applied fixes to the full colourspace Smith-Waterman algorithm. In
	  some cases we were not tracing back into the proper matrix. Initial
	  crossovers are now charged.
	- Added Phil Lacroute's mergehits utility.
	- Taught rmapper and prettyprint to handle multiple contigs per genome
	  file.
	- Fixed a minor bug that would miss hits within the first window of a
	  contig.
	- Fixed a bug in probcalc that would recalculate rates on non-regular
	  files.
	- Added surrounding bases to pretty-printed genome output.
	- Taught probcalc and prettyprint to handle symlinks.
	- Taught probcalc to accept multiple results arguments as both files and
	  directories of files.
	- Taught SHRiMP about wobble codes (by considering them as mismatches).
	- Added -S flag to probcalc and made double pass mode the default (now
	  probcalc uses much less memory at a higher runtime cost).
	- Added -C and -F options to rmapper to specify the strand.
	- Misc. portability and compilation fixes.
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.3: Fall 2007
	- Internal development version. S-W fixes and probcalc double pass.

1.0.2: November 6, 2007
	- Fix invalid assertion in common/output.c:output_pretty.
	- probcalc progress bar disabled by default (enabled by -B flag).
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.1: November 2, 2007
	- First public release. New output format.
	- '-b', '-p' flags changed to '-B', '-P'. (Parameters lowercase,
	  options uppercase).
	- Multiple contig support and internal reverse-complementing of contigs.

1.0.0: Summer 2007
	- Internal development version. Old ouput format.
