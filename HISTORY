1.0.4: January 24, 2008
	- Changed rmapper default parameters to be more appropriate for the
	  human genome.
	- Applied fixes to the full colourspace Smith-Waterman algorithm. In
	  some cases we were not tracing back into the proper matrix. Initial
	  crossovers are now charged.
	- Added Phil Lacroute's mergehits utility.
	- Taught rmapper and prettyprint to handle multiple contigs per genome
	  file.
	- Fixed a minor bug that would miss hits within the first window of a
	  contig.
	- Fixed a bug in probcalc that would recalculate rates on non-regular
	  files.
	- Added surrounding bases to pretty-printed genome output.
	- Taught probcalc and prettyprint to handle symlinks.
	- Taught probcalc to accept multiple results arguments as both files and
	  directories of files.
	- Taught SHRiMP about wobble codes (by considering them as mismatches).
	- Added -S flag to probcalc and made double pass mode the default (now
	  probcalc uses much less memory at a higher runtime cost).
	- Added -C and -F options to rmapper to specify the strand.
	- Misc. portability and compilation fixes.
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.3: Fall 2007
	- Internal development version. S-W fixes and probcalc double pass.

1.0.2: November 6, 2007
	- Fix invalid assertion in common/output.c:output_pretty.
	- probcalc progress bar disabled by default (enabled by -B flag).
	- Misc. documentation updates.

1.0.1: November 2, 2007
	- First public release. New output format.
	- '-b', '-p' flags changed to '-B', '-P'. (Parameters lowercase,
	  options uppercase).
	- Multiple contig support and internal reverse-complementing of contigs.

1.0.0: Summer 2007
	- Internal development version. Old ouput format.
